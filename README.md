# UFO

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a dynamic web page that allows for in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Instructions 
To populate the web page with data of interest to you, enter a date, city, state, country, or UFO shape - or a combination of these - in the corresponding boxes. Results from the criteris you enter should appear in the table. 

For example, in the image below you see one criteria entered - a date - and the corresponding results in the adjacent table.

## Summary
In sum, the data suggest that a surf and ice cream shop could thrive based on temperature data alone. The typical high is consistent across both months, and both months appear to be warm enough to sustain demand. Still, further analysis of typical a) precipitation and b) hours of sunlight would enhance the sustainability analysis and the potential for year-round business.
