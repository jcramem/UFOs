# UFO

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a dynamic web page that allows for in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Instructions 
To populate the web page with data of interest to you, enter a date, city, state, country, or UFO shape - or a combination of these - in the corresponding boxes. Results from the criteria you enter should appear in the adjacent table. 

For example, in the image below you see one criteria entered - a date - and the corresponding results in the adjacent table.

## Summary

Although this web page provides a good start to analyzing these data, it is understood that these data are limited in scope given the amount of sightings that have been reported. In the future, anticipate an enhancement that will allow for additional data to be collected and verified so that the repository can become more comprehensive. Plus, the addition of a moderated user forum is being considered that will allow users to provide more detail and discussion about sightings. Until hen, keep your eyes toward the skies.
