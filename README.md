# UFO

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a dynamic web page that allows for in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Instructions 
To populate the web page with data of interest to you, enter a date, city, state, country, or UFO shape - or a combination of these - in the corresponding boxes. Results from the criteria you enter should appear in the table. 

For example, in the image below you see one criteria entered - a date - and the corresponding results in the adjacent table.
